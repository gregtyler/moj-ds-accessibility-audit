	<p>On the following page you will be shown a table that shows a list of Prison Offender Managers (POMs) and their work caseload. The caseloads consist of how many prisoners they have and what tier the prisoners are in.</p>
	<p>We would like you to go through this table and see whether the information presented is legible in terms of colour, contrast and readability.</p>
	
	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
		<li>In the 'active probation officer POM' tab, look at Stephen Dicks, does tier A or B have more cases? How many in each?</li>
		<li>For Laura does tier B or C have more cases? How many in each?</li>
		<li>For Kian does tier C or D have more cases? How many in each?</li>
		<li>How many cases does Alexandra have in tier D? (there should be no cases and so it doesn't appear on the bar chart)</li>
		<li>On a screenreader can you tell how many cases there are in tier A for Stephen?</li>
		<li>Can you refer back to the key to find out what tier A is?</li>
		<li>On a screenreader how many cases does Alexandra have in tier D?</li>
		<li>How many cases does Laura have that are tier 'N/A'?</li>
		<li>In the 'active prison officer POMs' how many cases does Katy have in tier A?</li>
